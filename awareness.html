<h1>What are the main pollutants to the ocean?</h1>
 
    
  
<h2>Oil Pollution</h2>
    
<p1> Other than plastic, oil is a major contributor to ocean population growth. Knowing how frequently oil spills occur near and in the marine ecosystem, the water in the ocean becomes dirtier by the day. Animals that live in the ocean are also negatively impacted, as they have reproduction problems as well as other disabilities and health issues.Oil pollution in the ocean is due from the release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons into oceans and rivers directly or the environment around it. Oil pollution is extremely harmful to marine animals such as birds, mammals, and fish. According to nationalacademies.org over 210 million gallons of petroleum enter the sea each year from extraction, transportation and consumption of crude oil. The oil population extends far beyond the ocean.As it can have long-term consequences,  oil pollution can contaminate the water we need to stay alive everyday as well as contaminating food. While the oil population spreads over surfaces, it travels in very thin layers capable of preventing oxygen from reaching living specimens.

<h2>Plastic Waste</h2>
    
<p1>Plastic waste is one of the leading causes of ocean pollution. Every week, hundreds of thousands of pieces of plastic are dumped into the ocean. Plastic water bottles, plastic straws, and plastic grocery bags, which are given out at most grocery stores to store your purchases, are examples of this. Every year, at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean.  Many sea animals are adversely affected by the plastic that is being dumped into the ocean, and some tragically die as a result of the plastic.<p1>
